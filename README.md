# ai_auto_dj
## Handles DJ Software (Auto-DJ for Mixxx) with Tensorflow and python-rtmidi.

This is a program that controls any dj-software (in the future) using the basic
capabilities provided with MIDI message.
Some examples "Play", "Cue", "Fast Forward", "Fader up", "Fader down" etc.

This is an algorithm that gets as input a playlist, predicts Points Of Interest
of the songs included and generates the proper MIDI Messages.

The implementation was only created for usage with the Mixxx dj-software.

This project provides tools to create data sets and train, test and validate
Machine Learning models.

The datasets used will be uploaded...
